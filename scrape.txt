LAST ONE FOR A BIT (sketch commissions)  after this one will get in to upgrades.
see you then^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
( ill try to work as fast as I can tho im buring out. if I can maybe get 2 more weeks in I think I can maybe slow down)

ill be taking $40 full body SKETCH commissions

 this is what it will look like&gt;&gt;&gt;

https://www&#46;deviantart&#46;com/phation/.....y/65538209/SKT

and last weeks sketches&gt;&gt;&gt;

https://cdn&#46;discordapp&#46;com/attachme.....57/unknown.png

(PLZ RESPOND AS FAST AS YOU CAN WHEN I NOTE YOU, I ONLY GIVE MY SELF SO MUCH TIME PER BATCH, if you don't respond back ill have to drop you and move on. also let me know if you have to drop out, I work really fast so there is no time to delay un till the last second to tell me, thank you) 

 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO)
 ONE OC PER COMMMISSION
 I want to get 5 sketches done a day so if you can responded soon to your notes that will help me a lot.
 since this is sketches you get a vary fast jester pose sketch to see if that works for you. 

 all I need from you is a SFW ( if you have one) of your OC and maybe a pic of a pose you like me to do or give me freedom to draw what ever.
 or give me words that will describe how they want to look like, cute, cool, shy, ECT.

 later on you can upgrade your sketch for $50 for a full stand up. 

 (Q? why you not streaming like last time) as of not my net is kinda sucking so cant do it for now, also kinda want to take time with out rushing much.)

 for peps in line (6-10) you will wait a few days but just be ready to note back and forth.

 hope this works out.
 (also plan on doing this all week maybe 2)


 (RULEz: PLZ READ)
 when getting a commission you will need to have the[ money in hand] i know things pop up but just make sure you can pay for it. if you don't ill have to drop you and move on to the next one.
 and
 have a [idea of the commission] you want, i dont want to spend weeks trying to get something you don't know what you want. i have other peps waiting for there work so this will help if you know what you want. so have your REFs and themes ready to go, thank you.
 when you are picked PLZ don't note me ill note you. expect it in that week, i try to go in order of pep who get to the spot first. i try to work on 2 at a time when one is don't i note the next person in line. make a good work flow for me. so be ready to respond back with in that week i post the openings.

 :how long will it take?
 hope less then a week, depending how i feel and how complex the comich is. between 1 to 3 days talking to you. some time longer if live hits me. 
 :will you take NSFW?
 MAYBE cost will be x2 so a sfw will be $90 and a NSFW will be $180 for each fur. no deductions.
 :can i have a pic with RU? 
 you can, but that will be a $200 cameo fee + you extra (90) and BG (-100+) i know peps really like RU reason so high is don't want a lot of RU request pic.
 if you have any more Q? just ask in this journal.


 ill be taking 5 slots.
 first come first serve. check in to see if you made it on the list.

(PLZ RESPOND AS FAST AS YOU CAN WHEN I NOTE YOU, I ONLY GIVE MY SELF SO MUCH TIME PER BATCH, if you don't respond back ill have to drop you and move on. also let me know if you have to drop out, I work really fast so there is no time to delay un till the last second to tell me, thank you) 

 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO)
 ONE OC PER COMMMISSION
 I want to get 5 sketches done a day so if you can responded soon to your notes that will help me a lot.
 since this is sketches you get a vary fast jester pose sketch to see if that works for you. 

 all I need from you is a SFW ( if you have one) of your OC and maybe a pic of a pose you like me to do or give me freedom to draw what ever.
 or give me words that will describe how they want to look like, cute, cool, shy, ECT.

 later on you can upgrade your sketch for $50 for a full stand up. 

 (Q? why you not streaming like last time) as of not my net is kinda sucking so cant do it for now, also kinda want to take time with out rushing much.)

 for peps in line (6-10) you will wait a few days but just be ready to note back and forth.

 hope this works out.
 (also plan on doing this all week maybe 2)


 (RULEz: PLZ READ)
 when getting a commission you will need to have the[ money in hand] i know things pop up but just make sure you can pay for it. if you don't ill have to drop you and move on to the next one.

 hope less then a week, depending how i feel and how complex the comich is. between 1 to 3 days talking to you. some time longer if live hits me. 
 :will you take NSFW?
 MAYBE cost will be x2 so a sfw will be $90 and a NSFW will be $180 for each fur. no deductions.
 :can i have a pic with RU? 
 you can, but that will be a $200 cameo fee + you extra (90) and BG (-100+) i know peps really like RU reason so high is don't want a lot of RU request pic.
 if you have any more Q? just ask in this journal.

			patreon (PLZ READ) if you realy want me to stil be posting
		
	
	
		

			
				
					
						
												ok as of now been posting for about 192 week (3 years 6 months) posting 3 to 6 pic in that week. and been seeing it drop more and more then grow. could be I charge per week, or hard times with pep or money work becoming stall or some pep think I have another account and think that is me (only have one as of now) so going try to do a few things one change the weekly to monthly (to that will kill what I make now do to how little I have) lower the price( evening killing it more( if it dose not not grow) 

also was thinking to make a NSFW patreon but do to some being taken down did not think will work out that well. tho IF YOU REALLLLLY WANT IS SPEEK UP AND FUCK WHY NOT, wont be to happy but why ever you get what you want.

iv did as much as I can I don't really permute my patreon even when I do lil to no one really pitches in and all the ones out they that are doing good are NSFW still you would think some one who works 18-22 hrs day to make work would get a lil more notes im sorry if that sounds selfish but I really do try to give you the best I can even working when im sick to I still work, posting something you may like. 


SO PLZ LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

stick with the work I have now SFW

or you really want me to go on make a NSFW patreon



here is my&gt;&gt;&gt;

https://www.patreon.com/RUZarptag

thank you If you support.
im just sad of all the work I do I don't see to get any were.
just a lil heated, sorry.....

			to my fans and watchers. 
		
	
	
		

			
				
					
						
												just want to say thank you for watching me and commenting on my work.

just going thro some old work I did and the some of the peps who comment on all most ever post,

then some years go by and gone from the site, what im saying is even tho I dont respond back to much I do pay attention to who watches me.

I do miss my old fans who make a mark then leave the site (maybe do to life stuff) and not saying any one is better then the others just hate seeing 

peps leave. 

so what im trying to say is thank you for all you do. looking, commenting, or what ever you make you mark. 

in a way I kinda become your fan if you show up and make your mark^^

////////////

any ways hope you like the fan art, one more week of it then back to my own work.

hope to see you all in the next post^^
